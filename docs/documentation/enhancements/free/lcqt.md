title: Migrating to LCQT Bypasses
---

:::tip
If you would like an excellent alternative to Lilith's Lunar bypasses, Lunar Client QT is a free, open source custom launcher for Lunar Client that allows you to modify the client with agents (don't confuse them with forge mods). Some agents include one to enable Lunar+ features, all cosmetics and emotes, one to customize your hurt-camera shake, and one to enable Freelook, AutoTextHotKey, and Lunar Staff modules like Lilith does. Since some Lilith bypasses can interfere with certain Hypixel Mods, using LCQT in combination with Lilith is much more effective than just Lilith.
